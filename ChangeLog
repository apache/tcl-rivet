	* src/mod_rivet.h
	    Added RIVET_NEW_CONF macro to create a new rivet_server_conf.

	* src/mod_rivet.c
	    Added Rivet_MergeDirConfig to merge directory configurations.

	    Fixed bug where RivetDirConf was giving erroneous information.

2002-01-08  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

	* tests/makeconf.tcl
	    Went ahead and copied over the entire rivet directory.

	* tests/rivet.test
	    Changed the default port to 8081.

	* tests/template.conf.tcl
	    Changed the default port to 8081.
	    Removed access.conf and srm.conf.

2002-01-08  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* tests/makeconf.tcl (makeconf): Added a command to copy over the
	    init.tcl file to the testing directory.  It would probably be
	    best to copy the whole directory, though.

2002-01-08  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

	* src/channel.c
	    Just a text change.

	* src/make.tcl
	    Added a command to install that will copy the contents of the
	    rivet/ directory into Apache's install location.

	* src/mod_rivet.h
	    Removed some superfluous code and deprecated options.

	* src/mod_rivet.c
	    Finished renaming the rest of the remaining commands into the
	    standard Rivet_ naming scheme.  This will prevent any further
	    interferance with other modules.

	    Renamed namespacePrologue to request_init and re-coded the
	    namespace initialization code in Tcl.

	    Removed leftover references to the ::request::UPLOAD array.

	    Added an array called 'server' to the global namespace which
	    briefly contains important information about Apache and Rivet.

	    Propagated RivetServerConf, RivetDirConf and RivetUserConf arrays
	    at the tcl level.

	    Gave RivetUserConf the ability to set BeforeScript, AfterScript
	    and ErrorScript.

	* src/tcl_commands.c
	    Updated makeurl to use Tcl objects instead of the old Tcl_SetResult
	    command.

	* rivet/
	    Added a rivet/ directory of Tcl code.

	    Added init.tcl to rivet/.  This file contains initialization code
	    in a ::Rivet namespace that is called when the server starts up.

	* rivet/init.tcl
	    Added a command for cleanup after each request.  It currently
	    does nothing but could come in handy later.

	* rivet/packages
	    Created a rivet/packages directory for future Rivet packages.

	* rivet/rivet-tcl
	    Created a rivet/rivet-tcl directory containing a few procs.

	* rivet/rivet-tcl/load_response.tcl
	    Added 'load_response' command to rivet-tcl/.

	* rivet/rivet-tcl/parray.tcl
	    Added 'parray' command to rivet-tcl/.

2002-01-07  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* General: Renamed some more commands so that Rivet may be run
	alongside mod_dtcl.

	* src/mod_rivet.c (get_parse_exec_file): Oops - change httpd-tcl
	to httpd-rivet in strcmp.

2002-01-06  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* Documentation: Big cleanup, updating everything from mod_dtcl.

	the parser.

	* src/make.tcl: Add nodes for testing library.

2001-11-21  David N. Welton  <davidw@dedasys.com>

	* src/channel.c: Almost all output is based on the ApacheChan
	channel, and uses Tcl's buffering, flushing, etc...

	* tests/rivet.test: Updated testing scheme to work with lots of
	test files/ttml files.

2001-11-21  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>

	* src/mod_rivet.c

2001-11-20  Damon J. Courtney <damon@unreality.com>
