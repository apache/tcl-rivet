To do:

* Security review: I would like someone with security background to
  thoroughly go over the code.

* Script timeouts: set limits on the length of time a script will run
  before it returns or dies.

* General resource limits?

* More commands available for scripters (see PHP for examples).

* Possible configuration options: possible safe mode.

* Further internationalization (multibyte languages such as Japanese).

* Nicer logo - artists welcome!
