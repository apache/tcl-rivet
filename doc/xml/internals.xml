      This section easily falls out of date, as new code is added, old
      code is removed, and changes are made.  The best place to look
      is the source code itself.  If you are interested in the changes
      themselves, the Subversion revision control system
      (<command>svn</command>) can provide you with information about
      what has been happening with the code.

    	<title>Rivet approach to Apache Multiprocessing Models</title>
    	<para>
    		The Apache HTTP web server has an extremely modular architecture
    		that made it very popular among web developers. Most of the server
    		features can be implemented in external modules, including some of
    		the way the server interfaces to the operative system. The multiprocessing
    		modules are meant to provide different models for distributing the
    		server workload but also to cope with different operative systems
    		having their specific architectures and services.
    	</para>
    	<para>
    		From the very beginning mod_rivet was designed to work with
    		the  <ulink url="&apachedoc-prefork;">prefork MPM</ulink>
    		MPM (Multi Processing Module) which assumes the OS to have 'fork' capabilities.
    		This prerequisite basically restricted mod_rivet to work only with
    		Unix-like operative systems. Starting with version 3.0 we reorganized
    		mod_rivet to offer a design that could work together with more MPM and
    		hopefully pave the way to support different OS that have no 'fork'
    		call. At the same time we tried to preserve some of the basic
    		features of mod_rivet when working with the prefork MPM, chiefly the feature of
    		the Unix fork system call of 'cloning' a parent process
    		memory into its child, thus allowing fast initialization of interpreters.
    	</para>
    	<para>
    		The central design of mod_rivet now relies on the idea of <quote>MPM bridges</quote>,
    		loadable modules that are responsible to adapt the module procedural design to
    		a given class of Apache MPMs. This design is open to the development of more
    		MPM bridges coping with different multi-processing models but also to the development of
    		different approaches to resource consumption and workload balance. Currently we have 3 bridges: 
    	</para>
    	<itemizedlist>
    		<listitem>rivet_prefork_mpm.c: a bridge for the prefork MPM</listitem>
    		<listitem>rivet_worker_mpm.c: a threaded bridge creating a pool of threads
    		each running Tcl interpreters and communicating with the worker MPM threads
    		through a thread safe queue. This bridge is needed by the worker MPM.</listitem>
    		<listitem>rivet_lazy_mpm.c: a threaded bridge where Tcl threads are
    		started <quote>on demand</quote>. The bridge creates no threads and Tcl interpreters
    		at start up and only when requests come in Tcl execution threads are created.
    		This bridge is explained in detail in the <xref linkend="lazybridge">next section</xref>.     		
    		Since the resource demand at startup is minimal this bridge should suit
    		development machines that go through frequent web server restarts.</listitem>

    <section>
    	<title>mod_rivet MPM Bridge callbacks</title> 
    	<para>
    		A bridge is a loadable library implementing different ways to handle
    		specific features needed to mod_rivet. It was originally meant as a way
    		to handle the prefork/worker/event MPM specificities that prevented mod_rivet
    		from supporting each of them, at the same time avoiding the need to stuff the 
    		code with conditional statements that would have implied useless complexity (an
    		instance of the Apache web server can run only an MPM at a time), 
    		error prone programming and performance costs. 
    		New bridges could be imagined also to implement different models of workload
    		and resource management (like the resources demanded by the Tcl interpreters). 
			We designed an interface between the core of mod_rivet and its MPM bridges 
			based on a set of functions defined in the rivet_bridge_table structure. 
    	</para>

		<para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<emphasis>mpm_server_init</emphasis>: pointer to any
					specific server inititalization function. This field can be NULL
					if no bridge specific initialization has to be done. The core of
					mod_rivet runs the <command>ServerInitScript</command> before
					calling this function.</listitem>
					<listitem><emphasis>mpm_child_init</emphasis>: Bridge specific
					child process initialization. If the pointer is assigned with
					a non-NULL value the function is called by Rivet_ChildInit. 
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<emphasis>mpm_request</emphasis>: This pointer must
					be a valid function pointer to the content generator
					implemented by the bridge. If the pointer is not defined the Apache
					web server will stop at start up. This condition is motivated by
					the need of avoiding useless testing of the pointer. The fundamental
					purpose of a content generator module (like mod_rivet) is to respond
					to requests creating content, thus whatever it is
					a content generating function must exist (during the early stages of
					development you can create a simple test function for that). In a
					threaded MPM this function typically prepares the request processing 
					stuffing somewhere the pointer to the request_rec structure 
					passed by the web server and then it calls some method to communicate
					these data to the Tcl execution thread waiting for result to be
					returned. The <quote>prefork</quote> bridge is an exception since there
					are no threads and the bridge calls directly Rivet_SendContent
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<emphasis>mpm_finalize</emphasis>: pointer to a finalization
					function called during a child process exit. This function is registered
					as child process memory pool cleanup function. If the pointer is NULL
					the pool is given a default cleanup function (apr_pool_cleanup_null) 
					defined in src/mod_rivet/mod_rivet.c. For instance the finalize function
					in the <emphasis>worker</emphasis> MPM bridge notifies
					a supervisor thread demanding the whole pool of threads running Tcl 
					interpreters to orderly exit. This pointer can be NULL if the bridge 
					has no special need when a child process must exit (unlikely if you have
					multiple threads running)
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<emphasis>mpm_exit_handler</emphasis>: mod_rivet replaces
					the core <command>exit</command> command with a new one
					(<command>::rivet::exit</command>). This command must handle 
					the process exit in the best possible way for the bridge and the
					threading model it implements (for the 2 current threaded bridges this implies
					signaling the threads to exit). The <command>::rivet::exit</command>
					actually doesn't terminate the process, but interrupts execution
					returning a specific error code commands <command>::rivet::catch</command>
					and <command>::rivet::try</command> can detect. Before the process is terminated
					the <command>AbortScript</command> script is fired and <command>::rivet::abort_code</command>
					returns a message describing the exit condition. For instance
					the <emphasis>worker</emphasis> MPM bridge the finalize function
					is called after the current thread itself is set up for termination.
					See function Rivet_ExitCmd in
					<ulink url="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tcl/rivet/trunk/src/mod_rivet_ng/rivetCore.c">rivetCore.c</ulink>
					to have details on how and at what stage this callback is invoked.
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<emphasis>mpm_thread_interp</emphasis> must be a function returning
					the interpreter object (a pointer to record of type
					<command>rivet_thread_interp</command>) associated
					to a given configuration as stored in a <command>rivet_server_conf*</command>
					object. This element was temporarily introduced in the 
					<command>mpm_bridge_table</command> table and should be accessed
					through the macro RIVET_PEEK_INTERP.
					<programlisting>interp_obj = RIVET_PEEK_INTERP(private,private->conf);</programlisting>
					Every bridge implementation should have its own way to store interpreter data and manage their
					status. So this macro (and associated function)	should hide from the module core function
					the specific approach followed in a particular bridge

      <title>RivetChan</title>
      <para>
			The <structname>RivetChan</structname> system was created in
			order to have an actual Tcl channel that we could redirect
			standard output to.  This enables us use, for instance, the
			regular <command>puts</command> command in .rvt pages.  It
			works by creating a channel that buffers output, and, at
			predetermined times, passes it on to Apache's I/O system.
			Tcl's regular standard output is replaced with an instance of
			this channel type, so that, by default, output will go to the
			web page.

      <title>The <command>global</command> Command</title>
      <para>
			Rivet aims to run standard Tcl code with as few surprises as
			possible.  At times this involves some compromises - in this
			case regarding the <command>global</command> command.  The
			problem is that the command will create truly global
			variables.  If the user is just cut'n'pasting some Tcl code
			into Rivet, they most likely just want to be able to share the
			variable in question with other procs, and don't really care
			if the variable is actually persistant between pages.  The
			solution we have created is to create a proc
			<command>::request::global</command> that takes the place of
			the <command>global</command> command in Rivet templates.  If
			you really need a true global variable, use either
			<command>::global</command> or add the :: namespace qualifier
			to variables you wish to make global.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Page Parsing, Execution and Caching</title>
      <para>
			When a Rivet page is requested, it is transformed into an
			ordinary Tcl script by parsing the file for the &lt;? ?&gt;
			processing instruction tags.  Everything outside these tags
			becomes a large <command>puts</command> statement, and
			everything inside them remains Tcl code.
      </para>
      <para>
			Each .rvt file is evaluated in its own
			<constant>::request</constant> namespace, so that it is not
			necessary to create and tear down interpreters after each
			page.  By running in its own namespace, though, each page will
			not run afoul of local variables created by other scripts,
			because they will be deleted automatically when the namespace
			goes away after Apache finishes handling the request.
	      <note>
		    One current problem with this system is that while
		    variables are garbage collected, file handles are not, so
		    that it is very important that Rivet script authors make
		    sure to close all the files they open.
	      </note>
      </para>
      <para>
	    	After a script has been loaded and parsed into it's "pure Tcl"
	    	form, it is also cached, so that it may be used in the future
	    	without having to reload it (and re-parse it) from the disk.
	    	The number of scripts stored in memory is configurable.  This
	    	feature can significantly improve performance.

        <title>Extending Rivet by developing C code procedures</title>
        <para>
            Rivet endows the Tcl interpreter with new commands
            serving as interface between the application layer and the
            Apache web server. Many of these commands
            are meaningful only when a HTTP request is under way and 
            therefore a request_rec object allocated by the framework 
            is existing and was passed to mod_rivet as argument of a callback. 
            In case commands have to gain access to a valid request_rec
            object the C procedure must check if such 
            a pointer exists and it's initialized
            with valid data. For this purpose the procedure handling requests 
            (Rivet_SendContent) makes a copy of such pointer and keeps it
            in an internal structure. The copy is set to NULL just before
            returning to the framework, right after mod_rivet's has
            carried out its request processing. When the pointer copy is NULL 
            the module is outside any request processing and this
            condition invalidates the execution of
            many of the Rivet commands. In case they are called  
            (for example in a ChildInitScript, GlobalInitScript, 
            ServerInitScript or ChildExitScript) they fail with a Tcl error 
            you can handle with a <command>catch</command> command.
        </para>
        <para>            
            For this purpose in <option>src/rivet.h</option> the macro
            CHECK_REQUEST_REC was defined accepting two arguments: the thread
				private data object and the command name. If the pointer is NULL
            the macro calls Tcl_NoRequestRec and returns TCL_ERROR
            causing the command to fail. These are the steps to follow
            in order to write a new C language command for mod_rivet

      <title>Debugging Rivet and Apache</title>
      <para>
			If you are interested in hacking on Rivet, you're welcome to
			contribute!  Invariably, when working with code, things go
			wrong, and it's necessary to do some debugging.  In a server
			environment like Apache, it can be a bit more difficult to
			find the right way to do this.  Here are some techniques to
			try.
      </para>
      <para>
			The first thing you should know is that Apache can be launched
			as a <emphasis>single process</emphasis> with the
			<option>-X</option> argument:
		</para>
		
		<programlisting>httpd -X</programlisting>.

		<para>
			On Linux, one of the first things to try is the system call
			tracer, <command>strace</command>.  You don't even have to
			recompile Rivet or Apache for this to work.
      </para>

      <programlisting>strace -o /tmp/outputfile -S 1000 httpd -X</programlisting>

      <para>
      	This command will run httpd in the system call tracer,
			which leaves its output (there is potentially a lot of it) in
			<filename>/tmp/outputfile</filename>.  The <option>-S</option>
			option tells <command></command>strace to only record the
			first 1000 bytes of a syscall.  Some calls such as
			<function>write</function> can potentially be much longer than
			this, so you may want to increase this number.  The results
			are a list of all the system calls made by the program.  You
			want to look at the end, where the failure presumably occured,
			to see if you can find anything that looks like an error.  If
			you're not sure what to make of the results, you can always
			ask on the Rivet development mailing list.
      </para>

      <para>
			If <command>strace</command> (or its equivalent on your
			operating system) doesn't answer your question, it may be time
			to debug Apache and Rivet.  To do this, you will need to rebuild mod_rivet.
			First of all you have to configure the build by running the
			<command>./configure</command> script with the
			<option>-enable-symbols</option> option and after you have
			set the CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>export CFLAGS="-g -O0"
export LDFLAGS="-g"
./configure --enable-symbols ......
make
make install</programlisting>
		<para>
			Arguments to <command>./configure</command> must fit your Apache HTTP
			web server installation. See the output produced by
		</para>
		<programlisting>./configure --help</programlisting>
		<para>
			And check the <xref linkend="installation">installation</xref> page to
			have further information.
			Since it's easier to debug a single process, we'll still run
			Apache in single process mode with -X:
