    <title>Apache Rivet Installation</title>
    <procedure>
        <para>
            Check your OS website for a binary package of Apache Rivet. 
            Rivet 2.1 runs with the Apache Apache 2.2.x and 2.4.x server. 
            It is known to run on various Linux distributions 
            (Debian &amp; Ubuntu, Redhat, SuSE and CentOS), FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
            Currently there is no way to run Apache Rivet on Windows&copy; with Apache 2.2, since 
            no <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mpm.html">Multi-Processing Module</ulink>
            other than
            <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/prefork.html">prefork</ulink> is supported.
            Efforts are under way to extend the support to the 
            <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/worker.html">worker</ulink> MPM, which could
            open the possibility to run Apache Rivet also with the 
            <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mpm_winnt.html">winnt</ulink> MPM.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you need to compile Apache Rivet yourself this is the procedure to follow
        </para>
        <step performance="required">
            <title>Install Tcl</title>
            <para>
                To build Rivet, you will need to install the shell (<command>tclsh</command>), 
                the development headers and the libraries from Tcl (&ge;8.5.10). You will tell Rivet 
                build scripts where Tcl is located via the <option>--with-tcl</option> option to 
                <command>configure</command> (see below).

            <title>Get Rivet</title>
            <para>
                Download the sources at <ulink url="http://tcl.apache.org/rivet/download.html"/>.  
            </para>
          </step>
          <step performance="optional">
            <title>Get and Install Apache Sources</title>
            <para>
                Rivet needs some Apache include (.h) files in order to build.  The easiest way 
                to get them is to download the source code of the Apache web server, although some systems
                (Debian GNU/Linux for example) make it possible to install only the headers and other 
                development files.  If you intend to build Rivet statically (compiled into the Apache web
                server instead of loaded dynamically), you definitely need the sources.  
                We recommend that you build Rivet as a loadable shared library, for maximum flexibility,
                meaning that you also build Apache to be able to load modules. Other than that, 
                the default Apache install is fine.  We will tell Rivet where it is located via the 
                <option>--with-apxs</option> option to <command>configure</command> (see below).
            </para>
            <para>
                The source code for the Apache web server may be found by following the links here: 
                <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/"/>.
            </para>

            <title>Uncompress Sources</title>
            <para>
              We will assume that you have Apache installed at this point.
              You must uncompress the Rivet sources in the directory where you
              wish to compile them.
              <programlisting>gunzip rivet-X.X.X.tar.gz
tar -xvf rivet-X.X.X.tar.gz</programlisting>

	<title>Building Rivet</title>
	<substeps>
	  <step>
	    <para>
	      On Linux or Unix systems, Rivet uses the standard <command>./configure ; make ; make install</command> technique.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      There are several rivet specific options to configure that might be useful (or needed):
	      <variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>--with-tcl</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
		      This points to the directory where the
		      <filename>tclConfig.sh</filename> file is located.
		    </para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>--with-tclsh</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>This points to the location of the
		      <filename>tclsh</filename> executable.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>--with-apxs</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>The location of the <filename>apxs</filename>
		      program that provides information about the
		      configuration and compilation options of Apache modules.</para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>--with-apache-version=[1|2]</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
			This option tells the build scripts whether you want to build Rivet for the
			Apache 1.x or Apache 2.x server.
		    </para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>--with-apache-include[=DIR]</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
			    Locates the Apache include files on your computer, if they're not in standard directory. 
		    </para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		  <term>--enable-version-display=[yes|no]</term>
		  <listitem>
		    <para>
			This option enables Rivet to display its version in the logfiles when Apache is started. 
			The default is to keep Rivet version hidden.
		    </para>
		  </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
		<varlistentry>
		    <term>--with-rivet-target-dir=DIR</term>
		    <listitem>
			<para>
			    This option tells the install script where Rivet's Tcl packages have to be copied. 
			</para>
		    </listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	      </variablelist>
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Example: configuring the build system to compile Rivet for an apache 2.x server, using tcl8.5 and
		specifying a custom name for the apxs program. 
	    </para>
	<programlisting>./configure --with-tcl=/usr/lib/tcl8.5/ --with-tclsh=/usr/bin/tclsh8.5 \
	    --with-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs2 --with-apache=/usr --with-apache-version=2</programlisting>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <title>Run make</title>
	    <para>
	      At this point, you are ready to run make, which should
	      run to completion without any errors (a warning or two
	      is ok, generally).
	    </para>
	  </step>
	  <step>
	    <title>Install</title>
	    <para>
	      Now, you are ready to run the <command>make
		install</command> to install the resulting files.
		This should copy the shared object (like
		<filename>mod_rivet.so</filename>, if one was
		successfully created, into Apache's
		<filename>libexec</filename> directory, as well as
		install some support scripts and various code.
	    </para>
	  </step>
	</substeps>
      </step>
      <step>
	<title>Apache Configuration Files</title>
	<para>
	  Rivet is relatively easy to configure - we start off by
	  adding the module itself:
	</para>

	<programlisting>LoadModule rivet_module	<replaceable>/usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rivet.so</replaceable></programlisting>

	<para>
	  This tells Apache to load the Rivet shared object, wherever
	  it happens to reside on your file system.  Now we have to
	  tell Apache what kind of files are "Rivet" files and how to
	  process them:
	</para>

	<programlisting>AddType application/x-httpd-rivet .rvt
AddType application/x-rivet-tcl .tcl</programlisting>

	<para>
	  These tell Apache to process files with the
	  <filename>.rvt</filename> and <filename>.tcl</filename>
	  extensions as Rivet files.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The characters encoding can be changed using the <command>header type</command> command,
	  but you can also change the default charset for the whole site:
	</para>
	<programlisting>AddType 'application/x-httpd-rivet;charset=utf-8' rvt</programlisting>
	<para>
	   All the pages generated by Rivet on this site will be sent with a 
	    <command>Content-Type:'text/html;charset=utf-8'</command> header.
	</para>
	<para>You may also wish to use Rivet files as index files for
	directories.  In that case, you would do the following:</para>
	<programlisting>DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.shtml index.cgi index.tcl index.rvt</programlisting>
	<para>
	  For other directives that Rivet provides for Apache
	  configuration, please see <xref linkend="directives"/>.
	</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>
