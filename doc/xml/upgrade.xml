    <title>Upgrading from mod_dtcl or NeoWebScript</title>
    <para>
      Rivet is a break from the past, in that we, the authors, have
      attempted to take what we like best about our past efforts, and
      leave out or change things we no longer care for.  Backwards
      compatibility was not a primary goal when creating Rivet, but we
      do provide this information which may be of use to those wishing
      to upgrade from mod_dtcl or NWS installations.

      <para>
	Rivet was originally based on the dtcl code, but it has
	changed (improved!) quite a bit.  The concepts remain the
	same, but many of the commands have changed.
