Graphic files that are to be displayed in the manual must be in the doc/images/ directory. 
Files in this directory are copied into the doc/html/images directory where they are referenced 
by the html pages. Files are to be added to svn manually. References to this files must be relative
to the manual root and therefore look like

<graphic fileref="images/calendar.png" />
