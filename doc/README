Graphic files that are to be displayed in the manual must be in the doc/images/ directory. 
Files in this directory are copied into the doc/html/images directory where they are referenced 
by the html pages. Files have to be added to svn manually. References to this files must be relative
to the manual root and therefore they look like

<graphic fileref="images/calendar.png" />

Code examples can be put in their native form in 'doc/examples'. 
Adding new examples to the documentation is a 4 step procedure now:

 1) Compile and install Rivet

 2) Create a new code example in the doc/examples directory. The file has to keep code
in native form, i.e. capable to run when placed in your webspace.

 3) Run 'make examples'. This procedure will collect the files in 'examples' and store them
escaped into 'examples-sgml'. Thus files in this directory are fit for inclusion in 
XML/XHTML documentation

 4) Update the manual to add the reference to the newly generated example.
