			    KNOWN PROBLEMS
			    ==============


 - Rivet is reported to conflict with cgi scripts on some Linux machines.
Symptom of the problem is when cgi scripts hang forever and don't send contents
to the client

 
			    RIVET NAMESPACE
			    ===============

 - With the intruduction of the Rivet namespace the command set has been
moved into '::rivet' and should now be fully qualified. Commands are exported
though and can be imported in the global namespace, but whenever possible this
is deprecated.  Putting the following code in the Server Conf should guarantee
compatibility with existing scripts

RivetServerConf	    ServerInitScript	"package require rivet"
RivetServerConf	    ServerInitScript	"package require rivetlib"
RivetServerConf	    ServerInitScript	"namespace import --force ::rivet::*"
