BUGS
====

* Using user conf variables eats up memory.  Find a better way to create and
  destroy them.

TODO
====

* Write commands after like 'open' and such in the request namespace
  that keep track of open file pointers and close them in the cleanup.

* Complete the NWS package.

* Swipe include_* from NWS and rework it like: include ?-virtual?
  ?-noparse? file

* Re-write load_file.  This basically loads an entire .tcl file into
  the current document instead of sourcing it.  This will allow us to
  cache even pages which only source a huge .tcl file.  load_virtual
  should do the same but relative to the document root.

* Create escape_string and unescape_string using Apache conventions.

* Free all Rivet commands of apache dependencies, which are moved into
  the TclWebapache.c file.  Compatible file, for CGI only operating,
  TclWebcgi.c needs to be created.

* Need to add a local.tcl for local procs and setup.

* Documentation in XML.

MAYBE
=====

* Maybe move ::request commands into a file called request.tcl.
