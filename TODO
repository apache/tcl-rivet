BUGS
====

TODO
====

* Add a command in Tcl that will return a file relative to the document root.

* Write commands after like 'open' and such in the request namespace
  that keep track of open file pointers and close them in the cleanup.

* Complete the NWS package.

* Swipe include_* from NWS and rework it like: include ?-virtual?
  ?-noparse? file

* Add a '-virtual' option to include and parse.  This will include or
  parse a file based on the server root.

* Re-write load_file.  This basically loads an entire .tcl file into
  the current document instead of sourcing it.  This will allow us to
  cache even pages which only source a huge .tcl file.  load_virtual
  should do the same but relative to the document root.

* Create escape_string and unescape_string using Apache conventions.

* Free all Rivet commands of apache dependencies, which are moved into
  the TclWebapache.c file.  Compatible file, for CGI only operating,
  TclWebcgi.c needs to be created.


MAYBE
=====

* Maybe write load_cookies in Tcl and try to get rid of the
  apache_cookie.* stuff.

* Maybe move ::request commands into a file called request.tcl.
