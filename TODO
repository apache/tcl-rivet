Write commands after like 'open' and such in the request namespace that
keep track of open file pointers and close them in the cleanup.

Complete the NWS package.

Swipe include_* from NWS and rework it like:
    include ?-virtual? ?-noparse? file

Add a '-virtual' option to include and parse.  This will include or parse
a file based on the server root.

Re-write load_file.  This basically loads an entire .tcl file into the
current document instead of sourcing it.  This will allow us to cache
even pages which only source a huge .tcl file.  load_virtual should do the
same but relative to the document root.

Create escape_string and unescape_string using Apache conventions.

Add a PackageRequire Server directive that will load packages on start-up.


MAYBE

Maybe write load_cookies in Tcl and try to get rid of the apache_cookie.* stuff.

Maybe write the header command in Tcl.

Maybe move ::request commands into a file called request.tcl.


DONE
