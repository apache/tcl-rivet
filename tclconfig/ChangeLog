	* tcl.m4 (TEA_CONFIG_CFLAGS): support eVC4 Win/CE builds

2004-08-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_INIT, TEA_PREFIX): update handling of exec_prefix to
	work around subdir configures since autoconf only propagates the
	prefix (not exec_prefix).

2004-07-23  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Darwin section: brought inline with
	Tcl 8.5 HEAD config, removed core specific & obsolete settings.

2004-07-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_PATH_X): check in TK_DEFS for MAC_OSX_TK to see if
	we are compiling on Aqua.  Add TEA_WINDOWINGSYSTEM var that
	reflects 'tk windowingsystem' value.

2004-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_ENABLE_THREADS): force a threaded build when
	building against a threaded core.
	(CFLAGS_WARNING): Remove -Wconversion for gcc builds
	(TEA_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Reorder configure.in for better 64-bit build
	configuration, replacing EXTRA_CFLAGS with CFLAGS.  [Bug #874058]
	Update to latest Tcl 8.5 head config settings.
	Call this TEA version 3.1.

2004-04-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_TCL_64BIT_FLAGS): replace AC_TRY_RUN test with
	AC_TRY_COMPILE for the long vs. long long check. (kenny)

2004-04-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_TCL_64BIT_FLAGS): update against core tcl.m4 to
	define TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG if 'using long'.

2004-03-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: correct Windows builds getting LDFLAGS info in MAKE_LIB

2004-02-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: correct TCL_INCLUDES for private headers on Windows - it
	doesn't need the eval.

2004-02-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: don't require TK_INCLUDES and TCL_INCLUDES to have the
	DIR_NATIVE vars defined when using private headers on unix.
	Allow $... to TEA_ADD_SOURCES for constructs like
	TEA_ADD_SOURCES([\$(WIN_OBJECTS)]), that allow the developer to
	place more in the Makefile.in.
	tkUnixPort.h checks for HAVE_LIMITS_H, so do both HAVE and
	CHECK on limits.h

2003-12-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* Makefile.in:      added TEA_ADD_LIBS, TEA_ADD_INCLUDES and
	* configure:        TEA_ADD_CFLAGS to configurable parameters with
	* configure.in:     PKG_* equivs in the Makefile.  This allows the
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: user to worry less about actual magic VAR names.
	Corrected Makefile.in to note that TEA_ADD_TCL_SOURCES requires
	exact file names.

2003-12-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: updated OpenBSD support based on [Patch #775246] (cassoff)

2003-12-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure:
	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.in (VPATH): readd $(srcdir) to front of VPATH as the
	first part of VPATH can get chopped off.
	Change .c.$(OBJEXT) rule to .c.@OBJEXT@ to support more makes.
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4: add TEA_ADD_STUB_SOURCES to support libstub
	generation and TEA_ADD_TCL_SOURCES to replace RUNTIME_SOURCES as
	the way the user specifies library files.

2003-12-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* configure:           Update of TEA spec to (hopefully) simplify
	* configure.in:        some aspects of TEA by making use of more
	* Makefile.in:         AC 2.5x features.  Use PACKAGE_NAME (instead
	* generic/tclsample.c: of PACKAGE) and PACKAGE_VERSION (instead of
	* tclconfig/tcl.m4:    VERSION) arguments to AC_INIT as the TEA
	package name and version.
	Provide a version argument to TEA_INIT - starting with 3.0.
	Drop all use of interior shell substs that older makefiles didn't
	like.  Use PKG_* naming convention instead.
	Move specification of source files and public headers into
	configure.in with TEA_ADD_SOURCES and TEA_ADD_HEADERS.  These will
	be munged during ./configure into the right obj file names (no
	$(SOURCES:.c=.obj) needed).
	There is almost nothing that should be touched in Makefile.in now
	for the developer.  May want to add a TEA_ADD_TCL_SOURCES for the
	RUNTIME_SOURCES that remains.
	Use SHLID_LD_FLAGS (instead of SHLID_LDFLAGS) as Tcl does.
	Only specify the user requested LDFLAGS/CFLAGS in the Makefile,
	don't mention the _OPTIMIZE/_DEBUG variants.

2003-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: create a TEA_SETUP_COMPILER_CC the precedes the
	TEA_SETUP_COMPILER macro.  They are split so the check for CC
	occurs before any use of CC.  Also add AC_PROG_CPP to the compiler
	checks.

2003-10-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: Updated for autoconf 2.5x prereq.
	Where TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE would be __int64, defer to the code checks
	in tcl.h, which also handles TCL_LL_MODIFIER* properly.

2003-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: correct default setting of ARCH for WinCE builds.
	Correct \ escaping for CE sed macros.

2003-04-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: replace $(syscal) construct with older `syscall` for
	systems where sh != bash.

2003-04-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_WITH_CELIB): add --enable-wince and --with-celib
	options for Windows/CE compilation support.  Requires the
	Microsoft eMbedded SDK and Keuchel's celib emulation layer.

2003-02-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_ENABLE_THREADS): Make sure -lpthread gets passed on
	the link line when checking for the pthread_attr_setstacksize
	symbol. (dejong)

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_SETUP_COMPILER): added default calls to
	TEA_TCL_EARLY_FLAGS, TEA_TCL_64BIT_FLAGS,
	TEA_MISSING_POSIX_HEADERS and TEA_BUGGY_STRTOD.

2003-02-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: correct HP-UX ia64 --enable-64bit build flags

2003-01-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: check $prefix/lib as well as $exec_prefix/lib when
	looking for tcl|tkConfig.sh, as this check is done before we would
	set exec_prefix when the user does not define it.

2003-01-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Fix build support
	for mingw, the previous implementation would
	use VC++ when compiling with mingw gcc. Don't
	pass -fPIC since gcc always compiles pic code
	under win32. Change some hard coded cases
	of gcc to ${CC}.

2002-10-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: move the CFLAGS definition from TEA_ENABLE_SHARED to
	TEA_MAKE_LIB because setting too early confuses other AC_* macros.
	Correct the HP-11 SHLIB_LD_LIBS setting.
	
	* tcl.m4: add the CFLAGS definition into TEA_ENABLE_SHARED and
	make it pick up the env CFLAGS at configure time.

2002-10-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: add --enable-symbols=mem option to enable TCL_MEM_DEBUG.
	Improved AIX 64-bit build support, allow it on AIX-4 as well.
	Enable 64-bit HP-11 compilation with gcc.
	Enable 64-bit IRIX64-6 cc build support.
	Correct FreeBSD thread library linkage.
	Add OSF1 static build support.
	Improve SunOS-5 shared build SHLIB_LD macro.

2002-07-20  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiware.com>

	* tcl.m4: Added MINGW32 to list of systems checked for Windows build.
	Also, fixes some indentation issues with "--with-XXX" options.

2002-04-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_ENABLE_THREADS): added USE_THREAD_ALLOC define to
	use new threaded allocatory by default on Unix for Tcl 8.4.
	(TEA_CONFIG_CFLAGS): corrected LD_SEARCH_FLAGS for FreeBSD-3+.

2002-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4 (TEA_SETUP_COMPILER): removed call to AC_CYGWIN so that
	we can use autoconf 2.5x as well as 2.13.  This prevents us from
	being able to warn against the use of cygwin gcc at configure
	time, but allows autoconf 2.5x, which is what is shipped with most
	newer systems.

2002-04-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: Enabled COFF as well as CV style debug info with
	--enable-symbols to allow Dr. Watson users to see function info.
	More info on debugging levels can be obtained at:
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvc60/html/gendepdebug.asp

2002-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: change all SC_* macros to TEA_*.  The SC_ was for
	Scriptics, which is no more.  TEA represents a better, independent
	prefix that won't need changing.
	Added preliminary mingw gcc support. [Patch #538772]
	Added TEA_PREFIX macro that handles defaulting the prefix and
	exec_prefix vars to those used by Tcl if none were specified.
	Added TEA_SETUP_COMPILER macro that encompasses the AC_PROG_CC
	check and several other basic AC_PROG checks needed for making
	executables.  This greatly simplifies user's configure.in files.
	Collapsed AIX-5 defines into AIX-* with extra checks for doing the
	ELF stuff on AIX-5-ia64.
	Updated TEA_ENABLE_THREADS to take an optional arg to allow
	switching it on by default (for Thread) and add sanity checking to
	warn the user if configuring threads incompatibly.

2002-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: made sure that SHLIB_LDFLAGS was set to LDFLAGS_DEFAULT.
	Removed --enable-64bit support for AIX-4 because it wasn't correct.
	Added -MT or -MD Windows linker switches to properly support
	symbols-enabled builds.

2002-03-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: called AC_MSG_ERROR when SC_TEA_INIT wasn't called first
	instead of calling it as that inlines it each time in shell code.
	Changed Windows CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to use -O2 instead of -Oti.
	Noted TCL_LIB_VERSIONS_OK=nodots for Windows builds.
	A few changes to support itcl (and perhaps others):
	Added support for making your own stub libraries to SC_MAKE_LIB.
	New SC_PATH_CONFIG and SC_LOAD_CONFIG that take a package name arg
	and find that ${pkg}Config.sh file.  itk uses this for itcl.

2002-03-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: made SC_LOAD_TKCONFIG recognize when working with a Tk
	build dir setup.
	Added EXTRA_CFLAGS and SHLIB_LD_LIBS substs to SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	Added XLIBSW onto LIBS when it is defined.
	Remove TCL_LIBS from MAKE_LIB and correctly use SHLIB_LD_LIBS
	instead to not rely as much on tclConfig.sh cached info.
	Add TK_BIN_DIR to paths to find wish in SC_PROG_WISH.
	These move towards making TEA much more independent of *Config.sh.

2002-03-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: corrected forgotten (UN)SHARED_LIB_SUFFIX and
	SHLIB_SUFFIX defines for Win.
	(SC_PATH_X): made this only do the check on unix platforms. 

2002-03-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README.txt: updated to reflect fewer files

2002-03-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* config.guess (removed):
	* config.sub (removed): removed unnecessary files

	* installFile.tcl (removed):
	* mkinstalldirs (removed): these aren't really necessary for
	making TEA work

	* tcl.m4 (SC_PUBLIC_TCL_HEADERS, SC_PUBLIC_TK_HEADERS): don't
	check /usr(/local)/include for includes on Windows when not using
	gcc

2002-03-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tcl.m4: added warnings on Windows, removed RELPATH define and
	added TCL_LIBS to MAKE_LIB macro.

	This import represents 2.0.0, or a new start at attempting to
	make TEA much easier for C extension developers.

	**** moved from tclpro project to core tcl project, ****
	**** renamed to 'tclconfig'                         ****

2001-03-15    Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

	* installFile.tcl: Added updating of the modification time of
	  the target file whether we overwrote it or decided that it
	  hadn't changed.  This was necessary for us to be able to
	  determine whether or not a module install touched the file.

2001-03-08    Karl Lehenbauer <karl@procplace.com>

	* installFile.tcl: Added support for converting new-style (1.1+) 
	  Cygnus drive paths to Tcl-style.

2001-01-15    <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* tcl.m4: Added FreeBSD clause.

2001-01-03    <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* tcl.m4: Fixed typo in SC_LIB_SPEC where it is checking
	for exec-prefix.

2000-12-01    <brent.welch@interwoven.com>

	* tcl.m4: Concatenated most of the Ajuba acsite.m4 file
	so we don't need to modify the autoconf installation.
	* config.guess:
	* config.sub:
	* installFile.tcl:
	Added files from the itcl config subdirectory,
	which should go away.

2000-7-29    <welch@ajubasolutions.com>

	* Fixed the use of TCL_SRC_DIR and TK_SRC_DIR within
	TCL_PRIVATE_INCLUDES and TK_PRIVATE_INCLUDES to match their recent
	change from $(srcdir) to $(srcdir)/..
