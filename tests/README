Test Suite for Rivet
====================

$Id$

These tests are intended to automate the testing of core Rivet
features.  They are not complete at this point, and work on them would
be welcome.

How to run the tests:
--------------------

The program 'runtest.tcl' is launched with the full path to the apache
web server.  It then creates a minimal config file in the directory it
is launched from, and launches Apache with the generated config.  We
are thusly able to manipulate the environment completely, and run the
tests directly in the tests/ directory...

Note that mod_so.c must be compiled into Apache for this to work, or
Apache must be compiled with Rivet built in.

For example:

./runtest.tcl /usr/sbin/apache

Where to put tests/which files are which:
----------------------------------------

binary.test: Test whether an image file comes through ok.

broken.test: Test whether a broken page displays an error message
	     correctly.

config.test: Test different configuration combinations.

cookies.test: Test whether cookies work.

env.test: See if 'environmental' variables are coming through alright.

get.test: Test whether a simple GET works with variables
	  (i.e. ?foo=1&bar=2)

hello.test: Test whether a simple hello world page works.

include.test: Test whether flat file includes work.

lang.test: Try some japanese encodings, to see if they come through
	   ok.

makeurl.test: Test whether the 'makeurl' command works.

parse.test: Test whether the 'parse' command is able to correctly
	    parse and utilize a second .rvt file.

post.test: See if POST works ok.

rivet.test: This starts the tests up and runs them.

tclfile.test: Make sure that Rivet works ok with a plain .tcl file.

upload.test: Check whether file uploads work.
