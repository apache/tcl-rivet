libapache2-mod-rivet
-----

This package provides mod_rivet, an apache module that endows the Apache server 
with the ability generate content by scripting pages using the Tcl command 
language (http://www.tcl.tk).

Though mod_rivet can run on its own, this packages ships also a library of
Tcl packages for transparent dbms access and session management.
