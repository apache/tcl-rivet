This directory contains an individual .tcl file for each proc in Rivet and
a line in the tclIndex file for each corresponding .tcl file and procedure.

This is done for two major reasons:

1) Code is easy to manage.  If you want to edit a procedure, you know right
   which file to look in.

2) No code is loaded needlessly into the interpreters.  Since each command
   resides in its own .tcl file, and those files are not sourced until the
   command is needed, there is no loading of superfluous procs or code
   when a particular command is needed.

So, basically, if you want to add a single command to the Rivet library,
you can easily do it by adding it as a .tcl file here.  Name the file
<commandName>.tcl, and then add it to the tclIndex file.  You can either
do this by hand or by Tcl's built-in functions.  IE:

$ tclsh
% auto_mkindex . *.tcl

This should produce the desired result.

This is NOT the directory to add packages or entire libraries of code.
See the rivet/packages/ directory for that.

There is a small trade-off to all of this.  The larger the proc library gets,
the larger the auto_load array gets, making auto loading procedures take a
little longer as the functions to load unknown commands have to pull the code
to load each command from this array.  But, the trade-off is really quite
nominal.  It will only even be used once, the first time a command is called.
Once a command is loaded, none of this code is even called.
