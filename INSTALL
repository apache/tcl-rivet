The only thing you need to install Rivet is a C compiler, linker, and
of course, Tcl!

Rivet is built by means of a Tcl make-like script which calculates
dependencies and runs the C compiler and linker.

To build mod_rivet.so, cd to the src/ directory, and run the make.tcl
script (using a tclsh linked against the libraries you want to use),
then copy that to your Apache libexec/ directory.

For more detailed instructions, see the docs/html/ directory.
