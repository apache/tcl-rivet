              Rivet 2.1 Installation
              ======================

For more detailed instructions, see the docs/html/ directory.

Rivet is now based on the autotools - autoconf, automake and libtool,
and so compilation is simple.  

1) run 'configure' with the appropiate options for your installation. (if you
are building Rivet from a working copy created by svn you have also to prepare
the source tree running 'aclocal; autoreconf' beforehand)

Example:

./configure --with-tcl=/usr/lib/tcl8.5/             \
        --with-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs                   \
        --with-tclsh=/usr/bin/tclsh8.5              \
        --with-apache-version=2                     \
        --with-rivet-target-dir=/usr/lib/rivet2.1   \
        --enable-version-display

2) if 'configure' was successful Rivet is ready for compilation

make

3) Install Rivet with the usual 

sudo make install

4) Install Rivet utils with

sudo make install-packages

if your configuration doesn't require you to have administrative privileges.

Along with the usual 'configure' variables Rivet's configure script 
handles other specific options. 

--with-tcl=DIR              Directory where tclConfig.sh is
                            stored. This is a shell script that
                            defines all the relevant symbols needed
                            to build Tcl related applications.
--with-apache-version=VER   Values are 1 or 2 depending
                            on the apache server you're 
                            builing the module for.
--with-apache=DIR           Apache server's root directory.
--with-apxs=FILE            Path to the apxs program to
                            be used in the compilation
                            process.
--with-apache-include=DIR   Apache's include files path.
--with-apr-config=FILE      Apache Portable Runtime 
                            metainformation program
--with-rivet-target-dir=DIR Rivet library installation directory.
--enable-version-display    Apache signature shows Rivet 
                            version number in the form Rivet/2.0.x. 
                            Default=no

These are the basic Apache configuration directives that are needed:

# Loads the module.
LoadModule rivet_module /path/to/your/copy/of/mod_rivet.so

# Let the module handle .rvt and .tcl files.
AddType application/x-httpd-rivet  rvt
AddType application/x-rivet-tcl    tcl

# The default charset can be specified in the configuration

AddType "application/x-httpd-rivet; charset=utf-8" rvt

If Apache1.x and Apache2.x coexist on the same system you must
tell configure where the right apxs (apache extension tool) script is
located. E.g.: on a Debian system apxs for Apache2.x is named apxs2

./configure --with-apache-include=/usr/include/apr-1.0          \
            --with-apache-version=2                             \
            --with-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs2                          \
            --with-tcl=/usr/lib/tcl8.6                          \
            --with-apache=/usr

Here is another example reported by a user who successfully built 
Rivet on Slackware 12.1

aclocal
autoreconf
./configure --with-apache-version=2 --with-tcl=/usr/lib --with-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs 
make

Rivet is packaged for various Linux flavours. A list is available at http://tcl.apache.org/download.html
