			  Rivet Installation
			  ==================

For more detailed instructions, see the docs/html/ directory.

The only thing you need to install Rivet is a C compiler, linker, and
of course, Tcl (8.4 or newer).

Rivet is built by means of Tcl based configure and make like scripts
which calculate dependencies and run the C compiler and linker.

To build mod_rivet.so, cd to the src/ directory, run the
./configure.tcl script, then run make.tcl. Make sure to use a tclsh
linked against the libraries you want to use for Rivet.  Then do a
./make.tcl install to install everything.

cd src
tclsh ./configure.tcl
tclsh ./make.tcl shared
tclsh ./make.tcl install

Basic Apache configuration directives that are needed:

# Loads the module.
LoadModule rivet_module	/path/to/your/copy/of/mod_rivet.so

# Let the module handle .rvt and .tcl files.
AddType application/x-httpd-rivet .rvt
AddType application/x-rivet-tcl .tcl
