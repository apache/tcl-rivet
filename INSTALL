The only thing you need to install Rivet is a C compiler, linker, and
of course, Tcl!

Rivet is built by means of Tcl based configure and make like scripts
which calculate dependencies and run the C compiler and linker.

To build mod_rivet.so, cd to the src/ directory, run the
./configure.tcl script, then run make.tcl. Make sure to use a tclsh
linked against the libraries you want to use for Rivet.  Then do a
./make.tcl install to install everything.

cd src
tclsh ./configure.tcl
tclsh ./make.tcl shared
tclsh ./make.tcl install
